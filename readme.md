*⏤ instagram wont let you know who unfollowed you ⏤ but this chrome extension will!*

---
### Steps to install this chrome extension:

1. clone this directory to your repo 
2. open your browser and type `opera://extensions` or in case of chrome type `chrome://extensions`
3. toggle `developer mode` ON, if its set to OFF
4. Now click on `Load Unpacked` button and select the file that contains code for the extension 
5. Now your extension will get loaded and you can use it.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

- This extension only works when you open [https://instagram.com/](https://instagram.com)
- also your follower page should be open, [https://instagram.com/yourusername/followers](https://instagram.com/yourusername/followers)
- then make sure you load all of your followers (as insta doesnt fully render all your followers till the time you dont scroll up -- lazy loading yk!)

These above steps are pre-requisites for running this extension - doesnt matter if youre saving current followers or finding unfollowers

**INFO about buttons**

1. `Save current follower` button: You only have to use this button when you want to save your current followers - otherwise no need to touch it

2. `Find Unfollowers` button: Use this button when you want to find that one person (or many) who unfollowed you - so that you can unfollow them later :). 

When you click on this `Find Unfollowers` button - a list of all the people who unfollowed you will appear, you can click on it and it will take you to their profile
